# Solar Power in India
In this case study a data analysis has been performed on data concerning solar power generation.
The data has been gathered at a solar power plant in India over a 34 day period. There is one power generation dataset and one sensor readings dataset. 
The power generation datasets are gathered at the inverter level - each inverter has multiple lines of solar panels attached to it. 
The sensor data is gathered at a plant level - single array of sensors optimally placed at the plant.  
  
In this research the following questions were answered:  
**Can we predict the power generation for next couple of days?    
Can we identify the need for panel cleaning/maintenance?  
Can we identify faulty or suboptimally performing equipment?**
